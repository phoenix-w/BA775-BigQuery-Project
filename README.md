## World Bank Dataset Exploration and Visualization in Tableau

### Project Summary
As a team, we were tasked with locating a dataset of our choosing, performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, and finally creating visualization in Tableau. We chose a World Bank dataset because of the varied and interesting indicators, the sizable number of observations, and the relevance of the subject matter. Each row in a table represents a country, containing information about the country itself and the corresponding indicator value.

### Project Objective
Our goal is to analyze the fluctuations in gender equality in different countries between 2000 to 2015 across education and employment indicators in high, upper middle, lower middle and low income segment groups. 

Some development indicators do not provide detailed gender level insights and therefore do not add value to our project objective. For the purpose of this project, we will only be looking at employment and education indicators. Additionally, we will only be looking at data between 2000 to 2015 since a significant number of indicators were missing for countries in the earlier years.

### Data Source
The World Development Indicators dataset was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/worldbank/world-development-indicators), while the raw dataset was from [The World Bank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators).

The dataset contains over 5.6 million rows with over 1340 annual indicators of economic development from over 200 countries around the world dated between 1960 to 2015. The indicators span across five key categories: education, employment, life expectancy, economic, and health.
